# Drip-Check
  This application is designed to give a user a way to test out clothing, while having us be able to implement a tamagotchi type game. Before the game starts, the user will have to give their character a name then click the submit button to move to the next screen.
  After, The user will be introducted to what the game is and how they will play.
  Once past the introduction screens, user will be able to test out clothing matches, to see what they like and give them a way to buy these pieces of clothing from the real website. The way the user will earn these pieces of clothing is to battle against an AI that will have clothing of their own on. A certain catergory of for style will be selected then depending who has the higher score for that, it will determine who wins. If the user wins, they will have a chest added to their to their chest invitory and be able to open it for more clothing.
  They will be able to swap the unlocked clothing and if they like the new clothing, the user can go to the clothing tab and get links for the clothing pieces that will bring them to the real site to buy the clothing.


# Error
  The application was not able to be updated with the new implemented methods, however, the models for how to get the data is there along with other methods needed.

# code validation
  The code for the model was ALSO not tested, so to say it will gurantee work woul be a false statement, but we can only hope it does theoretically!
